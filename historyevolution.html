            The Internet began in the 1960s as a means of sharing information among government researchers. Computers were larger and more stationary during the time. If someone needed to access the information contained in any computer, they had to either travel to the location of the computer or obtain magnetic computer tapes that could be carried via the postal system of the time. 
            In addition, the Escalated Cold War played a significant effect in the development of the internet. The Soviet Union had launched the Sputnik satellite, prompting the United States Defence Department to investigate the possibility of sending information despite nuclear weapons. As a result of the circumstance, ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was created, which later evolved into the Internet. ARPANET was a major success in its early days, with limited participation limited to academic and research organisations with contracts with the US Defence Department. The predicament prompted the creation of new networks to address the requirement for information sharing with others.  Earlier there was no standard system in place for computer networks to communicate with one another. TCP/IP, which was developed in 1970, was accepted as a new communication protocol for the ARPANET in 1983. The technology allowed computers on separate networks to speak with one another, and thus the Internet was founded on January 1, 1983.

        <h1 class="Header">INTERNET TIMELINE</h1>
        <pre class="Content pre1">
            <strong>1960s:</strong>The Birth of ARPANET
            <strong>1960:</strong>J.C.R. Licklider of MIT proposed the idea of a "Galactic Network" concept, envisioning a globally interconnected set of computers.
            <strong>1962:</strong>Licklider's idea led to the creation of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
            <strong>1969:</strong>The first successful message transfer between two computers was achieved on ARPANET, a precursor to the internet. ARPANET was designed to link computers at various
                universities and research institutions.
            <strong>1970s:</strong>Laying the Foundations
            <strong>1971:</strong>Ray Tomlinson implemented the first networked email program, allowing messages to be sent between computers on ARPANET.
            <strong>1973:</strong>The TCP/IP protocol suite was proposed by Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn, providing a common set of protocols for interconnecting different networks.
            <strong>1974:</strong>Cerf and Kahn published the first paper describing the TCP/IP architecture, setting the stage for the modern internet.
            <strong>1980s:</strong>Expanding the Networks
            <strong>1981:</strong>The term "internet" was used to describe a network of interconnected networks.
            <strong>1983:</strong>The ARPANET adopted the TCP/IP protocols, marking the transition from NCP (Network Control Protocol) to TCP/IP as the standard.
            <strong>1984:</strong>The Domain Name System (DNS) was introduced, providing a way to translate human-readable domain names into numerical IP addresses.
            <strong>1985:</strong>The National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the creation of NSFNET, a high-speed network backbone that connected research institutions across the United States.
            <strong>1989:</strong>Tim Berners-Lee of CERN proposed the World Wide Web (WWW) to organize and link information across the internet.
            <strong>1990s:</strong> Commercialization and the World Wide Web
            <strong>1990:</strong> Berners-Lee developed the first web browser, "WorldWideWeb," and the first web server software.
            <strong>1991:</strong>The first website, providing information about the World Wide Web project, went live.
            <strong>1993:</strong>The graphical web browser "Mosaic" was released, making the Web more user-friendly and popularizing internet use.
            <strong>1995:</strong>NSFNET was decommissioned, and commercial internet service providers (ISPs) began offering access to the public.
            <strong>2000s:</strong> Internet and Revolution and social media
            <strong>Early 2000s:</strong> The dot-com bubble burst, leading to more focused and sustainable internet-based businesses.
            <strong>2004:</strong> Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook, a social networking platform that revolutionized online communication.
            <strong>2007</strong> The launch of the iPhone and the rise of smartphones revolutionized mobile internet usage and access. 
            <strong>2010s and beyond:</strong> Ubiquity and Connectivity
            <strong>2010s:</strong> The internet became an integral part of daily life, with billions of users accessing information, entertainment, and services online.
            <strong>2020s:</strong> The internet continues to evolve with advancements in technologies like 5G, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT), shaping various 
                 industries and aspects of society.

               <p> The history of the internet exemplifies human ingenuity, collaboration, and the desire to link people and information across the world.<br> It has changed economies, civilizations, and communication, transforming how we connect with our surroundings.</p>

           <h1 class="Header">Evoluition of the Internet</h1>
           <pre class="Content">
            <strong>1962</strong>
            First concept.
            Licklider creates the concept of a “Intergalactic Network” — a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could 
            quickly access data and programs from any site — documented in a series of memos.
            <strong>1965</strong>
            ARPA. ARPA [later known as DARPA] funds Larry Roberts and Thomas Marill to create the first wide-area network connection — connecting the 
            TX-2 at MIT to the Q-32 in Santa Monica through a dedicated telephone line with acoustic couplers.
            <strong>1969</strong>
            The U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) connected four computer network nodes at the University of California, Los Angeles, (U.C.L.A.), 
            the Stanford Research Institute (S.R.I.) in Menlo Park, Calif., U.C. Santa Barbara (UCSB), and the University of Utah.    
            1970
            Creation of ARPANET. In 1971, ARPANET begins the year with 14 nodes — including East Coast universities. At the end of year, ARPANET consisted of 19 nodes.
            <strong>1972-1973</strong>
                In the first ten months of 1972, ARPANET had grown to 29 nodes.  In 1973, thirty institutions are connected to ARPANET — ranging from BBN, Xerox PARC, 
                MITRE Corporation, NASA, National Bureau of Standards, and U.S. Air Force
            
            <strong>1973</strong>
            ARPANET goes international. In 1973, DARPA [formerly ARPA] connects seven computers on four islands in Hawaii; and a satellite connection enables linkage to Norway 
            and the UK.
            
            <strong>1974</strong>
            Birth of TCP. In May 1974, Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf publish "A Protocol for Packet Network Interconnection". DARPA funds the development and implement of 
            the TCP protocol described in the Kahn-Cerf paper.
            
            <strong>1977</strong>
            Birth of TCP. In May 1974, Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf publish "A Protocol for Packet Network Interconnection". DARPA funds the development and implement of 
            the TCP protocol described in the Kahn-Cerf paper.In 1977, Cerf and Kahn demonstrate ‘internetting’ — messages go from a van in the Bay Area across the U.S. 
            on ARPANET, then to University College London and back via satellite to Virginia, and back through the ARPANET to the University of Southern California; 
            proving the applicability of international deployment.
            <strong>1982</strong>
            The community grows. As the ARPANET entered its second decade, it was still largely confined to the United States. Academic institutions depended on federal funding
             to join the network, so the number of nodes expanded slowly.
            
            <strong>1982-1983</strong>
            In March 1982, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) declared TCP/IP as the standard for all military computer networking. Soon after, a prominent research 
            group at University College London adopts the TCP/IP protocol. On January 1, 1983, ARPANET standardizes on the TCP/IP protocols already adopted by the DoD — marking 
            the birth of the modern internet.
            <strong>1986</strong>
            The 56Kbps backbone leads to the creation of regional feeder networks such as JVNCNET, NYSERNET, SURANET, SDSCNET and BARRNET.  TCP/IP is available on 
            workstations and PCs, and Ethernet is now wired inside buildings and campuses.
            <strong>1988</strong>
            Upgrading the backbone of the internet. 
            Upgrading the backbone to T1 allows the internet to become more international with connections to Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden.
            
            <strong>1988-1989</strong>
            Australia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom join the Internet. 
            In just one year the number of hosts worldwide increased by 120 000.
            
            <strong>1989</strong>
            Web. At CERN, in Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee creates the World Wide Web — a hypertext system that runs across the Internet on different operating systems.
            <strong>1991</strong>
            Rapid expansion of the internet. New countries coming online are Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Greece, India, Ireland, South Korea, Spain, and Switzerland.
             
            <strong>1992</strong>
            The number of computers connected to the internet surpasses 1,000,000. 
            In 1992, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, MOSAIC is born — which later became Netscape.
            <strong>1993</strong>
            Open vs Closed Internet. During this time, several for-profit tech companies such as AOL, CompuServe, and Microsoft attempted to centralize the internet — Microsoft 
            envisioned a closed system called the "Information Superhighway". In the end, open protocols won — allowing internet services to be built on open protocols 
            that were controlled by the internet community. This ensured entrepreneurs and organizations could grow their internet services without fear of platform risk from big tech.
            
            <strong>2017:</strong> 
            <strong>The DIFINITY Foundation:</strong>
            DFINITY Foundation is a not-for-profit organization based in Zurich, Switzerland, aiming to build the “Internet Computer” to extend serverless cloud functionality to the internet. 
            There are many implications to this idea, notably revolving around decentralizing the web and enabling autonomous software such as open versions of Facebook, 
            LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Salesforce, eBay, etc, and the ability to displace today's $3.9 trillion-dollar legacy IT stack.If successful, this would be a powerful 
            paradigm shift in how the internet operates.The Internet Computer is one of the most ambitious endeavors in technology, 
            and to accomplish this, DFINITY has assembled a large and highly credentialed team of renowned technologists.
            <strong>Present Day:</strong>
            The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is extending the internet with serverless cloud functionality and enabling secure software and a new breed of open internet services.  
            “The Internet Computer is a complete replacement of the $3.9T legacy IT stack... an "alternative" to proprietary infrastructure owned by Big Tech, 
            and allowing developers to create an open and free internet”  —Dominic Williams Founder and Chief Scientist at The DFINITY Foundation
            The Internet Computer reimagines software. Secure. Independent. Simple.
             
            The Internet Computer The Internet Computer extends the internet — enabling developers to natively host special “software canisters” and data.
            Formed by an open protocol that combines massive compute capacity provided by a global network of independent data centers. 
            The Internet Computer is secure and unstoppable, and built for websites, enterprise systems, smart contracts, DeFi systems, 
            and a new breed of open internet services that runs as part of the fabric of the Internet itself — reversing Big Tech's monopolization of the internet and ensuring a more collaborative future.
